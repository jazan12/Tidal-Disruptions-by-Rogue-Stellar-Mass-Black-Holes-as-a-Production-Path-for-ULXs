{\bf Tidal Disruptions by Rogue Stellar-Mass Black Holes:  Implications for GRB demographics and ULXs}\\

We propose that tidal disruption of post main-sequence stars by stellar-mass black holes as a candiate mechanism for
producing a large population of hyper-luminous and ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULX).  We specifically consider a parent population of such systems which occurs through dynamical encounters.  The short-lived transient event immediately following a major disruption is highly energetic and produces a signature at XXX.  However, we primarily consider the aftermath of a disruption event, during which the source declines from highly super-Eddington mass accretion rates, to the sub-Eddington regime.  During this long-lived transitional phase, lasting thousands of years, the accretion of the giant remnant onto the stellar-mass black hole would manifest as a ULX.   Implications and testable consequences of this scenario are discussed.
