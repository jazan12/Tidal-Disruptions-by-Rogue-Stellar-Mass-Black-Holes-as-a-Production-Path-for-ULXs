{\bf Tidal Disruptions by Rogue Stellar-Mass Black Holes:  Implications for GRB demographics and ULXs}\\



We propose a new class of high-energy transients with a typical
  fluence of order $10^{46}$~erg.  These transients can be produced
  through a variety of dynamical or tidal capture-type interactions
  between the black hole and a planet orbiting its companion star.  We
  discuss two cases of chief interest, one in which the planet is
  captured in a retrograde orbit about the black hole and dissipates
  angular momentum in the disk during a secular inspiral; the other
  involves fast-acting tidal disruption which destroys a planet after
  an external interaction perturbs the binary orbit.
