 {\bf FOR WDS:} Rates of impact for bodies of masses ranging from small comets ($\sim 10^{10}g$) to Jupiter-size ($\sim 10^{30}$g) in a typical WD system, using $\beta = 1.75$ and $\dot{M} = 10^{16}$g/yr.  The rates depend weakly on the scaling-mass assumed, with a typical choice of order the mass of Ceres indicated as a vertical dashed line.  These calculations do not take into account the size of the object, which will be of significant consequence, enhancing the rate, for masses greater than $M \sim 10^{26}$g.
