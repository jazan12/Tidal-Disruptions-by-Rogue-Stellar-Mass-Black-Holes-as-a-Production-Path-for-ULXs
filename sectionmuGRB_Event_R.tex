\section{$\mu$GRB Event Rates}\label{section:rates}



\begin{itemize}
\item NSs  ....
\item   1d7 years after starburst should expect peak ULX density
\item   expect to trace stellar density as density^2
\item   expect to trace young stellar population
\item   expect    1e-6/galaxy    is the rate at which expect ULXs formed via collisions
\item   could be binary channels w. e.g., kicks, etc.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Tidal Disruption}
Triggered by a perturbation in e.g., glob clust?


\subsection{Secular Migration}
Retrograde Orbits the Best\\
Prograde less so
